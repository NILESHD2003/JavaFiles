/*
notes
    ~A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, all the
    programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at
    the starting of the program's execution.
    ~MultiThreading helps use to Run/Execute a program faster.
    ~If we use MultiProcessing then we will run out of resources as Processing is heavy where as threading is low.
    ~Concurrency is about multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, in no specific order.
    ~Parallelism is about multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally run at the same time on a hardware
    with multiple computing resources like multi-core processor
